      <h2> General impression of homepage </h2>
      <p> My first impression of the <a href="https://chapelhillpubliclibrary.
      org/" target="_blank">Chapel Hill Public Library's website</a> is that 
      it looks very simple. The menu labels are clearly made for the “general 
      public” - users without the background in library and information 
      science. There is not a lot of information on the homepage and makes me 
      have to think on how to interpret a few words. </p>
      <h2> Digging deeper into Chapel Hill Public Library Website </h2>
      <p> The personalized reading recommendations are well thought out and laid
      out. The question prompts for users are well done and direct to 
      recommendations in a coherent manner. </p>
      <p> The hyperlinks on the homepage take users to pagers where the header 
      and menu look different. I myself had to double check several times and 
      ensure that I was still on the same page, I can only imagine what a user 
      who was actually trying to use this website would think. </p>
      <p> There are also no visible bread crumbs or “You’re Here” markers 
      anywhere on the website - or at least none that I could see - which makes 
      it really hard to navigate backwards or find the same place again. </p>
      <p> There is an option for “Bookkits” that users could request, however 
      there is no explanation on what these bookkits are. The link just takes 
      the user to all the available “options”. So a user would have to know what 
      these bookkits are before exploring this section, stumbling on it while 
      browsing would not be helpful. </p>
      <p> The events tab is very chaotic with a lot going on. Unlike other parts 
      of the website, this section is overwhelming and providing too much 
      information at once. The roll-over function was distracting to me – with 
      so much going on the page already, to have even more information provided 
      if a user would accidentally move their mouse over something would feel 
      overwhelming and I’d steer clear of that part of the website. </p>
      <p> In contrast, I thought the study room page was well laid out with just 
      enough information provided about the rooms, who can request them and how 
      to request a room. The pictures added a nice touch so that users could see
      what is included in the room, how big they actually are (not everyone is 
      great with dimensions) and get a visual for the room.</p>
      <h2> Feature of Website </h2>
      <p> For the purpose of this assignment, I will be focusing on the 
      navigational bar located at the top of the Chapel Hill Public Library 
      website. This bar remains fixed to the top of the page no matter where you
      navigate away from the homepage and also stays at the top of the screen 
      even when a user scrolls down to the bottom of the page. </p>
      <h2> Literature Review </h2>
      <p> TFor this assignment I will be studying Miller’s Law. While a lot of 
      the language in these articles went over my head, as I don’t have the 
      technology background, one common theme that I found among all of them 
      was a summarization of Miller’s Law. While I tried to get a variety of 
      different types of articles, approaching Miller’s Law from different 
      sides, I had a difficult time in doing so. </p>
      <p>The first article that I studied was the Miller’s Law page on 
      lawsofux.com. This page was a simple explanation of what Miller’s Law is 
      and where it derived from. According to this page, Miller’s law states 
      that “the average person can only keep 7 (plus or minus 2) items in their 
      working memory” <span class="empahsized">(Yablonski)</span>. It derived 
      from a psychological paper written and presented by George Miller in 1956. 
      It also states that the main unit of information is called a bit, which is 
      the amount of data necessary to make a choice between two equally likely 
      alternatives <span class="empahsized">(Yablonski)</span>. </p>
      <p> The second article came from Medium and was titled “Managing 
      Information Overload in UX Design: Miller’s Law”. This article discussed 
      what information overload is (a situation in which a user is overwhelmed 
      with too much information at once) <span class="empahsized">(Managing 
      information overload in UX design: Miller’s law 2021)</span>. Tim (the 
      author) states that “the lesson for UX/UI designers is clear: A crucial 
      part of our job is to ensure that just the right amount of information 
      appears on a website or app screen - enough to make it relevant, but not 
      so much that it causes information overload” <span class="empahsized">
      (Managing information overload in UX design: Miller’s law 2021)</span>.  
      The author goes on to say that one of the ways of doing this is by using 
      Miller’s law and a key concept of “chunking” - putting together 
      information in cohesive groups. He provides two recommendations as “must 
      dos” for website designers:
      <ol>
        <li> response times must be fast enough so that users don’t forget what 
        they were meant to be doing by the time the page loads and
        <li> the color of links, after clicked, must change - as a trail marker 
        or bread crumb - so that users aren’t required to remember where they’ve 
        been. <span class="empahsized">(Managing information overload in UX 
        design: Miller’s law 2021)</span>. </ol> </p>
      <p> The third article studied was published in SCENARIO OO: Power Journal 
      and titled “Information Anxiety: Towards Understanding.” Much like the 
      second article, this article studies the anxiety of information overload 
      and discusses the purpose of technology and good communication. Wurman 
      states that this purpose is to create possibilities for ideas that, 
      before, you hadn’t imagined or considered”; in other words, technology’s 
      purpose is to show users possibilities they would not have imagined on 
      their own <span class="empahsized">(Wurman, 2014)</span>. However, this 
      information must lead to understanding and not be provided just for the 
      sake of being there. </p>
      <p> The next article, also from Medium, was titled “Miller’s Law & it’s 
      misinterpretation - UX Knowledge piece Sketch #6”. This article I found 
      important in my study because it takes Miller’s Law and studies the 
      misconceptions that people often have with the law. Szerovay states that 
      “Miller’s law is not about how many items a navigation, or a drop-down 
      list should contain”, instead one should apply Hick’s Law, in conjunction 
      with Miller’s Law when considering the number of choices <span class="
      empahsized">(Szerovay, 2020)</span>. She states that the more options 
      people have to choose from increases the time in decision making, and the 
      less options given to users, makes the decision making move faster <span 
      class="empahsized">(Szerovay, 2020)</span> </p>
      <p> So after reading several articles on Miller’s Law, I thought it was 
      about time I went directly to the main source and read the original paper 
      that Miller’s Law derived from: “The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus 
      Two: Some Limits on Our Capacity for Processing Information''. This 
      article was first published in Psychology Review in 1956. In addition to 
      what the other articles have summarized, Miller also states that the 
      “general rule is simple: every time the number of alternatives is 
      increased by a factor of two, one bit of information is added” <span class
      ="empahsized">(Miller)</span>. This combines the idea of limiting the 
      amount of information (discussed in Szerovay’s, Wurman’s and Tim’s 
      articles) with the effective summation from the Laws of UX page. Another 
      thing to note, which other authors have made it clear in their articles, 
      is that Miller himself was more focused on the idea of chunking 
      information into easily understandable groups and less on the exact number 
      of bits to present to users.</p>
      <p> The sixth article that I studied was actually a chapter dedicated to 
      Miller’s Law out of the book “Laws of UX: using psychology to design 
      better products & services” by John Yablonski. This chapter did a great 
      job of distilling all the psychology discussion from Miller’s original 
      paper into UX talk. Yablonski states that Miller used the number seven as 
      a rhetorical method, and too many people have taken that number and made 
      it “law.” “Miller’s fascination with short-term memory and memory span 
      centered not on the number seven, but on the concept of chunking and our 
      ability to memorize information accordingly.” <span class="empahsized">
      (Yablonksi, 2020)</span>. Tying together the idea from Wurman’s article 
      about information being made to understand and chunking information (from 
      Miller’s paper), he states that when we chunk content in website design, 
      we are making it easier to comprehend. Yablonski also states that the 
      limit of chunks will vary depending on the individual - based on their 
      knowledge and the complexity of the information presented. So there is no 
      true “magic number.” <span class="empahsized">(Yablonksi, 2020)</span>.
      </p>
      <h2> Applying Findings from Literature to Website </h2>
      <p> After a very brief study of Miller’s Law, I can conclude that the <a 
      href="https://chapelhillpubliclibrary.org/" target="_blank">Chapel Hill 
      Public Library's website</a> has been developed using the very basic 
      principles of Miller’s Law. Looking through the homepage, there doesn’t 
      seem to be one area that has more than seven bits of information showing 
      at once, which coincides with the conception of Miller’s Law (although as 
      stated above, it doesn’t have to be seven exactly - it can be more or less 
      depending on the information being presented.) I think overall, it may 
      leave the homepage a bit underwhelming and also makes me, as a user, have 
      to think about where to find something if it’s not obvious that it’s one 
      of the major things presented.</p>
      <p> In looking at the main navigation menu in relation to Miller’s Law, 
      however, I think overall it is organized well. It is clear that 
      developers designed this navigation with their “everyday” person in mind 
      using titles that a person without a background in library science might 
      think in. (See snapshot below). Even within the navigation menu, options 
      never exceed seven within their respective categories. <img src="CH.png"

      screenshot1"/> </p>
      <h2> Conclusion </h2>
      <p> Using Miller’s Law, I conclude that the navigation menu for the Chapel 
      Hill Public Library website is well organized and doesn’t really need any 
      changes. If I were to make any recommendations, I’d suggest maybe creating 
      sub-categories for the events page so that it is slightly less 
      overwhelming - however, it is not necessary to understand and utilize the 
      navigation menu. </p>
