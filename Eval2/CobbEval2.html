<p>Evaluation 2 </p>
<p> LIS 636 </p>
<p> Fall 2022 </p>
<title> Durham County Library - A Website Built With Patrons In Mind </title>
<body>
<h1> Introduction </h1>
<p> As a patron of the <a href=https://durhamcountylibrary.org/"target="_blank"
>Durham County Library!</a>, the content of this evaluation was quite easy to 
gather as I use the website frequently.I found the website to be laid out in an 
efficient and effective manner, allowing users ease of access with minimal 
time searching. <p>
<h2> Audience and Tasks </h2>
<p> The main intended audience for the Durham County Library website is the
public - as it’s a public library: this being mainly adults, teens, families,
and older adults. There is also a link down at the bottom of the homepage for
those who wish to donate to the library (be it monetary donations, books, or
time). However it is my assumption that the majority of donors to the library
could also be considered patrons, so I will maintain that the intended audience
for the library website are the patrons - general public. As a patron, I could 
visit the Durham County Library website for any of the
following tasks: </p>
<ul>
  <li> Finding books and other media available </li>
  <li> Looking for COVID-19 Guidelines </li>
  <li> To print, scan, copy or fax documents </li>
  <li> Find a storytime </li>
  <li> Get a library card </li>
  <li> Check my account (where my holds, requests, due dates and fees are
  located) </li>
  <li> Reserve a room </li>
</ul>
<p>   Patron reasons for visiting the website are not limited to the above list,
however that is (I believe) generally the most common tasks for visitation. </p>
<p> The website designers made the ability to complete the above tasks
incredibly easy. All of these tasks have clear visibility front and center on
the homepage. <img src = https://prnt.sc/AJDfg1b69Nwj.jpg"alt="exampe image"
class="screen shot" id = screen shot 1"/> The first thing that a patron sees
when they open the website is a catalog search, directly below the search bar
is a series of call to action buttons that are titled with the header “Common
Tasks”. By clicking on any of the call to action buttons, a patron will be taken
to another page that provides the requested information depending on which
button they clicked on. These buttons are conveniently located next to the
library branch locations and hours of operation - which is often also
information that a user would be looking for on the website. The designers made
the buttons a different color than the background, so that they stand out and
it’s clear that you should click on the button to obtain more information. My
only concern with these call to action buttons is that if you simply click on
that button, it will take you directly to that page and away from the homepage,
instead of opening a new tab. While this may be fine for patrons who are coming
to the website for just one task, it might become cumbersome for patrons who
have more than one task to complete, as they have to press the back button or
home button to get back to the homepage. Another feature that makes completing 
tasks quite easy and convenient is the function that will translate the entire 
website into Spanish with the click of one button. To have this option 
built into their website makes the contents very accessible and also shows their 
patrons that the library cares about them and is there to help. </p>
<h2> Visible Components </h2>
<p> Although I’m sure that a lot of people would start this essay by first
discussing the visible components of the website, I chose to save these for last
for two reasons: </p>
<ol>
  <li> In my opinion, audience tasks and user abilities are more important in
  discussing a website design. </li>
  <li> In discussing the audience and users tasks and ability to complete those
  tasks, I have already highlighted some of the visible components. </li>
</ol>
<p> When I think of visible components of a website, words like content,
usability, aesthetics, visibility, interaction, lay-out, call-to-action, search
and contact come to mind. In this section of the essay, I briefly discuss these
components as they relate to the Durham County Library website. The content of 
this website should be pretty self-explanatory, as it is a library website. 
However, in addition to books and digital media available, patrons can also 
place holds on physical items including books, DVDs, CDs, Audiobooks, etc. 
Information about and the history of the library are also provided in the 
About Us drop down menu. As well as other Online Resources patrons may rely 
on their county library to provide. I believe the usability of this website 
is actually pretty great. Most functions seem easy to navigate and understand. 
The aesthetics of the website is clean cut with sharp corners for all the
edges. I think there are some spaces where it feels slightly cluttered. 
The use of dropdown menus is a great option to provide maximum information
without overloading the page with information all at once. Placing the catalog
search bar front and center is also great placement as that’s one of the first
things patrons see and probably the most used function on the website. The 
interaction of the website is average. There are obvious call to action
buttons without too much information overload all at once. The search bar can be
used to search the library catalog, but also by using the drop down button -
patrons can switch and search the website also.By placing the most commonly 
used features of the website up front, I believe it provides the most 
efficient and effective use of these features. The contact features of this 
website can be a bit confusing. Most patrons would be looking for a “contact us” 
button, however this website doesn’t have that. They have various contact options 
- physical address, phone number, website feedback option, social media links, 
and an Ask a Librarian button - all things that other websites may include in a 
“contact us” button. </p>
<h1> Conclusion </h1>
<p> Overall, I believe that the Durham County Library website is designed to
provide the most efficient use of time and space for its patrons and visitors by
utilizing call to action buttons, drop down menus and prominent placement of
most common tasks. </p>
