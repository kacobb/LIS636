      <h2> The Strategy Plane </h2>
      <p> When creating a website, two questions must be asked - and should be
        answered before any other steps are taken:
      <ol>
        <li> what do we want to get out of this product? </li>
        <li> What do our users want to get out of it? </li>
        These questions will likely be the base of which creators develop the
        website’s purpose. For the <a href="https://library.duke.edu/" target="_
        blank">Duke University Library’s website</a>, it is to:
      <ul>
        <li> Provide access to books, articles, and other online databases </li>
        <li> Provide resources for research help </li>
        <li> Provide resources for professors/course support </li>
        <li> Inform users about upcoming events </li>
      </ul>
      Users’ of the Library website hope to get:
      <ul>
        <li> A place where they can check out materials </li>
        <li> Resources for research help and courses </li>
        <li> Reserve a study room </li>
        <li> Find information (hours, locations, etc) about the library </li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <h4> Brand Identity </h4>
      <p> As a staff member at Duke University, I often hear a focus of Duke
        being similar to an Ivy League school and research focused. One of the
        first things that comes to my mind when I think of the Ivy League is
        organization. Looking at the Duke University Library website, I think
        part of Duke’s brand identity - when it comes to the strategy plane -
        is to appear well-organized. </p>
      <h4> User Segmentation </h4>
      <p> Part of the organization of the website is based on user segmentation
        and demographics. The main sets of demographics for the Duke Library are
        faculty, students, staff, donors (and other visitors). I think aside
        from the faculty, where it may be slightly harder to find things, the
        other demographic sets can find what they need relatively easily and
        quickly. </p>
      <h2> The Scope Plane </h2>
      <p> The main question to ask oneself when looking at the Scope Plane is
        what are you building and what are the goals and requirements of this
        product? The Duke University Library website is an academic library
        website which Duke University students, faculty, staff, donors, and
        visitors can access information and resources with. As a library
        website, where access to information is most important, the website’s
        requirements are mostly content based, but not all of them:
      <ul>
        <li> Library Information (content) </li>
        <li> Catalog search (function/content) </li>
        <li> Research help links (content) </li>
        <li> Contact Us/Help (Function/content) </li>
        <li> Course Support (content) </li>
        <li> Branding - Duke Colors, logo, etc. (Content) </li>
        <li> My Accounts (holds, fees, etc.) (Function/content) </li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <h2> The Structure Plane </h2>
      <p> The Structure Plane is all about how website developers structure the
      content of the website. The Duke University Library website is a top-down
      approach, based on the matrix structure with user centered, controlled
      vocabulary. Its organizing principles put the patrons first when
      structuring the website. Placing the search bar front and center of the
      website, a function that most users are likely to be using the website
      for, shows that developers had the users’ and their needs in mind. Right
      next to the search bar is a list of the main library hours, which is one
      of the most asked questions that librarians get from patrons. </p>
      <p> Developers have also used conceptual models when placing the “Ask
      Librarian” and “My Account” buttons at the top of the page - they’ve used
      common icons that users may recognize from other websites: (the speech
      bubble and profile icons respectfully). <img src="duke library 1.png" alt=
      example image of icons" class="screenShot" id=screnShot1" /> </p>
      <p> By using clearly labeled buttons, the user can see that to put a book
      on hold, they just click the green button labeled request. This will
      prompt the user to log in, if not already logged in, and then provide them
      with another request button. This double request button, although to some
      may seem redundant, will also help with error handling - it is the
      equivalent of a pop-up box asking “Are you sure you’d like this book?”
      Another area where error handling is evident is the popup that appears on
      the homepage instructing users who have had trouble with Elsevier, this
      popup provides a temporary solution to this problem, which they have heard
      multiple users having. </p>
      <p> While the metadata is not readily apparent to users, behind every
      resource listed in the catalog, there is metadata provided, one just needs
      to know what to look for. However, “every day” users (non-librarians or
      data minded users) aren’t concerned with seeing the metadata.</p>
      <h2> The Skeleton Plane </h2>
      <p> The Skeleton Plane is made up of three different designs: interface
      design (ability to do things), navigational design (ability to go
      places), and information design (communicating ideas). While you can
      argue that since a library’s purpose is to provide access to
      information, the Duke University library’s website is all information
      design, I argue that it actually uses both interface design and
      navigational design to achieve information design. Just as all five
      planes lead into and help each other (or hinder, if not designed
      properly), the three designs of the skeleton plane also help build each
      other up. </p>
      <h4> Interface Design </h4>
      <p> When looking at the interface design and the ability of users to do
      things, I gravitate towards things like visible buttons - the My Account
      button, Ask a Librarian button - and the search bars provided. These are
      features of the website that allow users to do things. </p>
      <h4> Navigational Design </h4>
      <p> The Duke University Library website uses a few different navigational
      design formats to help guide users around the site. Global navigation
      provides users menu bars that will drop down options of other locations on
      the website when users hover on them. Local navigation provides users with
      bread crumbs in the top left corner of the site that provides them with
      where they have been to get them to the current page they are viewing. A
      supplemental navigation is provided in the search bars, both for the site
      itself and the catalog (two separate search bars), when a user types a
      search in they will first get back any items that matched exactly what
      they searched for, but will also be provided with similar items that they
      are close to the item they are looking for. Courtesy navigation provides
      users with information about the library (hours of operation, other
      library hours and locations) and also options for contacting the library.
      </p>
      <h4> Information Design </h4>
      <p> The information design of the Duke University Library website is the
      content it provides users. Developers put answers to the most asked
      questions front and center where it is easily found, with other less
      commonly asked questions further in its pages. Looking at previous
      versions of the website, you might see content placed in different
      locations based on what questions librarians are frequently asked. Another
      feature that I appreciate developers placing with the information design
      is text provided once a user clicks a particular resource, informing them
      that this search was for Books and Media (a catalog search, and not a
      website search). Given that there are two different search bars, this text
      can be useful to users - especially if they’ve wandered around the website
      for some time. </p>
      <h2> The Surface Plane </h2>
      <p>  When discussing the surface plane for the Duke University Library
      website, we are speaking mainly of the vision. Paying attention to my
      eye tracking while exploring the website, I noticed that my eyes were
      instantly attracted to the catalog search bar and the hours of operation
      first, then they traveled north to see the menu items and My Account and
      Ask a Librarian above that. There is of course brand identity, of which
      we discussed earlier - the Duke University colors, logo, Blue Devil in
      the bottom of the page (as with most universities, branding is very
      important to get just right and Duke is very particular on what colors,
      logos, images can be used on their websites). To me the font used
      (Source Sans Pro) is clean and easy to read, yet slightly sophisticated
      - which gives me the impression of an academic library. Using boxes to
      define different areas (instead of say circles or even rounded corners)
      gives the clean lines, clear cut and polished look that an academic
      library would be known for. </p>
      <p> Placement of information is crucial for a library website, although
      librarians are tempted to provide all the information that they can at
      once, they have to be careful not to do this. Developers of the Duke
      University Library Website, put just enough information on the screen at
      once, so that users can digest that information without feeling
      overwhelmed. An example of this includes the gallery for news, events and
      exhibits toward the bottom of the page shows only a few items and not all
      of the items that can be listed under these titles. Another example is
      right next to the gallery, a list of “Upcoming Events” - only lists three
      events and then provides a link for “View All”. As a user this is
      appreciated more than some other features because oftentimes websites (for
      libraries or other organizations, offices, etc.) will provide too much
      information in these spaces and then it can overwhelm the page and take
      away from the rest of the features. I believe that the developers found an
      effective way to balance providing this information for users but not too
      much at once. </p>
      <p> Contrast of colors can be found throughout the website, however the
      most prominent displays of this are on the top of the homepage: both
      search bars are in a different color than the background behind them,
      which helps distinguish their presence from the rest of the content; the
      problem bar (discussed under the structure plane) has a slight yellow
      background which sets it apart from the white background of the body, but
      doesn’t make it glaringly different. (There is also an x in the top corner
      of the bar that allows users to get rid of the bar if it’s not pertinent
      to them.) The header and the body use Duke University branding colors to
      distinguish themselves from each other: header has Duke blue background
      with white font, whereas the body has a white background with a darker
      shade of the Duke Blue (almost black) font, all the links are in a bright
      royal blue color - on brand with Duke colors. <img search="duke library2.
      png." alt=example image of color contrasts of header, search bars" class="
      screenShot" id="screenshot2"/> </p>
      <p> While looking through other Duke University Library social media
      accounts, it looks like the branding is consistent throughout. Resources
      for web content and a style guide is also provided on the Duke University
      Library website under the “About” menu. </p>
